description: Step 3 of creating an entry point list
---

# Categories and sorting

This **step is optional**. Therefore, you will only need it if the list you are creating requires any of the following:

- **Sort** entry points differently **according to the audience**. In other words, sort them based on the different types of user.
- **Group** entry points **by Categories**. In other words, if the list of entry points needs to appear divided into categories on the full-view page (the one that appears when the user clicks on **"Other services"**)

To add categories or custom sorting options, click on **Add categories and custom sorting**.

If the list you are creating does not require any of the above, skip this step and click **Continue**.

## New personalization

{% hint style = "warning" %} **IMPORTANT**: If you create multiple personalizations, the first personalization that matches the audience will be selected, according to the order in which you created them (from top to bottom). If none of them match, then:

- The default sorting option indicated in step 2 (**Services**) will be used
- A simple list is generated without categories {% endhint %}

Follow these steps to configure each personalization:

1. Enter a name for your personalization in the **New personalization**&nbsp;field and click **Add personalization**.
2. Select the audience for that personalization in the **Select your audience** drop-down menu.
3. Sort the entry points for that audience

When you have created the personalizations that you need, you can simply order them with *drag &amp; drop*. Remember that the user will see the first personalization applied according to the audience.

To edit any of the personalizations, select them by clicking on their name and changing the audience, the categories and/or the order of the entry points.

To delete a personalization, click on the icon ![](../.gitbook/assets/icono_borrar.png) in the name of the personalization.

### Order and categories

To be able to divide a list by categories, you need to create at least one personalization. If you want the list to appear as if it is sorted by categories without taking the audience into account, simply create the personalization while ignoring the Audiences drop-down menu. Otherwise, indicate the audience in the **Select your audience** drop-down menu.

#### Sorting and categories

Add the name of the first category in the **New category name** field and click **Add category**. Repeat this step as many times as required.

The categories will be created as shown below. To order the entry points, simply drag them, one-by-one, in the order you choose, under the corresponding category:

To delete a category, click![](../.gitbook/assets/icono_borrar.png) in the category name.

Click **Continue** to continue the set-up and proceed to the next step.

{% hint style = "danger" %} **IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind throughout the creation process that clicking the **Continue** button does not save your changes.

If you need to save the changes in this step, click **Save draft** (in the upper right-hand corner). {% endhint%}
