# Preview and validation

In this last step you can see what the content of the list you are creating will look like.

The screen is divided into two parts:

- The left-hand side of the screen can be optionally used to filter the display based on the audiences a user can belong to. It would be akin to simulating the use cases of a user. Namely, what you can and cannot see depending on the audiences that apply to you.
- The right-hand side of the screen shows you what the user will see based on the audiences that you select on the left-hand side.

Use the option![](../.gitbook/assets/Add_use_case.png) to add audiences and move it to the right column. This allows you to simulate the use case of a user belonging to that audience.

Use the option![](../.gitbook/assets/remove_use_case.png) to remove an audience and not simulate that use case.

In this last step, click <strong>Save and publish</strong> to publish the list that you have just configured.

You can also click Save to save the changes and leave the list in a DRAFT state. At this point, you can run a test to see how the changes will appear before publishing them and impacting a large number of users.
