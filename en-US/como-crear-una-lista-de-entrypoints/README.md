# How to create an entry points list

## Create list

Click the **Create list** button:

Fill in the fields:

**List name**. Name of the list you are creating. This name is used to create the ID automatically. It therefore only supports numbers and letters, not special characters.

{% hint style = "info" %} You can change the value of this **List name** at any time (but not the **List ID**). {% endhint %}

**Select target page**. Select the target page where the list will be displayed.

All available target pages are shown (not just the ones on the Home Page)

**List ID**. This field is automatically filled out based on the value that you specify in the *List name* field.<br> You can edit this, but it is not recommended.

{% hint style = "warning" %} The **List ID** can only be edited when you are creating the entry point. It cannot be changed once it has been created. As such, make sure that the **List ID** meets your needs. {% endhint %}

Click **Create entry point list** to save the list and begin the configuration steps for that list.
