description: Step 1 of creating an entry point list
---

# Overview

In this first step, at the first level, you have the information about the ID of the list you are creating and the page on which it will be displayed.

If you need the ID of the list, click![](../.gitbook/assets/icono_copypaste.png) to copy it to the clipboard.

### Titles

#### List summary title

It is an optional field and represents the title of the list.

#### Full list title

This optional field is the title of the page that contains the full list. This page, which contains the full list, is shown if the user has checked the **Restrict the amount of services in summary view** box and the **Show "See all" in the summary view"** box.

{% hint style = "info" %} This is a new page that the user accesses by clicking the "Other services" link. {% endhint %}

### Visualization

In this section, you indicate how the entry points in the list will be displayed:

- **List**. To display the items in list mode.
- **Carousel**. To display the items in carousel mode.

{% hint style = "success" %} The lists will or will not have icons depending on the OB. Some OBs are configured in such a way that the lists support icons, and other OBs are configured so that they don't.

You will know this when you [configure the entry points](../como-crear-editar-un-entrypoint.md#crear-un-entrypoint), because you will have the option to add icons if they are supported. {% endhint %}

**Restrict the amount of services in summary view**. Check this box to restrict the number of icons displayed in the list.

**Amount of services summary view**. If you have checked the **Restrict the amount of services in summary view** box, it will indicate the maximum number of entry points to be shown.

**Show "See all" in the summary view**. Check this box to display the link that allows you to see the page with the full list of entry points.

{% hint style = "info" %}: wink: If you restrict the number of elements to show from the list, you should display the link so that the full list can be seen. {% endhint %}

### Entry point lists preview

In this section you can see what the list will look like when it is published.

Use the **LIGHT/DARK** control to see what it will look like in *dark mode* or *light mode*.

{% hint style = "warning" %} Keep in mind that this is only a preview, intended to give you an idea of what the content will look like. Remember that this step doesn't yet contain any real information about which entry points you are going to include or any other data.

In the last step, destined precisely for the preview and summary of the list configuration, you will see a more accurate image of what the content will look like. Even so, we recommend performing a [test](../como-hacer-un-test.md) before publishing the content to make sure that everything appears as you would like it to. {% endhint %}

Click **Continue** to continue setup and proceed to the next step.

{% hint style = "danger" %} **IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind throughout the creation process that clicking the **Continue** button does not save your changes.

If you need to save the changes in this step, click **Save draft** (in the upper right-hand corner). {% endhint %}
