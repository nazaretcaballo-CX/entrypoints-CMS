# How to edit an entry point or list

To edit an entry point or an entry point list, you have two options:

1. **Use the item's sub-menu**. Hover your cursor over the end of it's row and click![](.gitbook/assets/icono_submenu.png) and select the **Edit** option.

2. **Click on the item's row**. You can also click anywhere on the item that you want to edit from the overview. You will see that that row changes color when you move the mouse, and the cursor also changes so that you know that that area is clickable.

Once inside the item, there will be certain fields that are not editable. The rest of the content and configuration, however, can be modified. You can save and publish the changes or save them and start a [test](como-hacer-un-test.md).
