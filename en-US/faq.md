### I want to edit a copy of an entry point. How do I do it?

You just need to edit it and save the changes.

From the list of entry points, click on the row of the entry point you want to edit. Click on the![](.gitbook/assets/icono_menu_secundario.png) icon and then click **Edit**.

### I have edited an entry point that appears in several lists. Will the change be seen in all of them?

Yes, the change will be seen in all lists that contain said entry point, as long as it is in a list that is visible to the user.

### I'm creating a list. Despite filling in the "**Full list title" field, I don't see it in the "Services" preview in Step 2. What is going on?**

The preview in step 2 shows the list as the user will see it within a page. This title represents the name of the page that the user sees, for example, when the **Show "See all" in the summary view** option is activated and the user clicks on "Other services".

Take a look at this simple example, which is sure to help you:

### Can I see how users will see the content before I publish it?

Of course you can. In fact, it's recommended. To do this, you need to create a test. Check all the information about it in the section:

{% content-ref url = "how-do-a-test.md"%} [how-do-un-test.md](como-hacer-un-test.md) {% endcontent-ref%}
